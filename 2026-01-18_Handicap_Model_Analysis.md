# Committee Report: Handicap Model Recommendation (2026 Season)

**To:** Tournament Committee  
**From:** Chris Royce  
**Date:** January 18, 2026  
**Subject:** Analysis of "Potential" vs. "Trend" Handicap Methodologies

---

## 1. Executive Summary
The committee has completed a data-driven analysis of three handicap methodologies: **Best 3 (Potential)**, **Best 6 (Stability)**, and **Last 2 (Trend)**. To stress-test these models, we applied them to the actual 13-month scoring records of two distinct player types: **Greg Funk** (High Consistency) and **Scott Lucas** (High Volatility).

**Final Recommendation:** Retain the **Best 3 (Potential)** model as the standard for all 2026 SG@SG tournaments.

## 2. Industry Standards & Common Practice
Per USGA and R&A Handicap Committee guidelines, the primary objective of a handicap is to represent a player's **Potential Ability**, not their average score.

*   **Potential vs. Form:** Major committees (USGA/WHS) calculate indices using the best 40% of a player's recent scoring history (8 of 20). This is designed to filter out the "noise" of bad days.
*   **The "Trend" Fallacy:** While "Trend" handicaps (Last 2 or 3 rounds) are occasionally discussed in casual circles to catch "hot" players, they are widely discouraged for competitive play because they lack statistical significance. A player's last two rounds are more likely to be temporary outliers than a permanent shift in skill.

## 3. Comparative Model Analysis

| Metric | Calculation | Philosophy | Tournament Impact |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Last 2 (Trend)** | Avg of Last 2 Diffs | "What have you done *lately*?" | **Extremely Volatile.** penalizes hot streaks too harshly; rewards brief slumps too generously. |
| **Best 3 (Potential)** | Avg of Best 3 Diffs | "Show me your *ceiling*." | **Balanced.** Anchors players to their proven best golf. Protects the field from sandbaggers. |
| **Best 6 (Stability)** | Avg of Best 6 Diffs | "Who are you *usually*?" | **Stable/Slow.** Fair for casual play, but fails to catch rapidly improving players. |

## 4. Case Study: Head-to-Head Data

### Archetype A: The "Grinder" (Greg Funk)
*   **Profile:** Extreme consistency. 12 of last 13 rounds in the 70s.
*   **Recent Form:** Slightly cooling off (78, 79) compared to his peak (72).
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Last 2 (7.2 Index):** **FAIL.** This model gives him ~4 extra strokes because of two "average" weeks. If he returns to his 72-potential, he is effectively unbeatable.
    *   **Best 3 (3.2 Index):** **SUCCESS.** Anchors him to his demonstrated peak. He must play his best golf to win.

### Archetype B: The "Wildcard" (Scott Lucas)
*   **Profile:** High volatility. 14-stroke range between best (77) and worst (91).
*   **Recent Form:** Red Hot. Shot career-bests (77, 81) in his last two starts.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Last 2 (7.8 Index):** **FAIL.** Assumes his 77 is his "new normal." It strips 4 strokes instantly. If he regresses to his average (85), he is non-competitive.
    *   **Best 3 (9.9 Index):** **SUCCESS.** Blends his hot streak (77/81) with his proven historical ability (82). It tightens his handicap without making it impossible for him to compete.
    *   **Best 6 (12.8 Index):** **FAIL.** Too slow. It ignores his recent 77/81 entirely, giving him an unfair advantage over the field.

## 5. Committee Conclusion
The **"Last 2"** model is a statistical trap. While it appears to "catch" a hot player like Scott Lucas, it creates a much larger vulnerability by allowing consistent players like Greg Funk to inflate their handicap during a brief 2-week slump.

The **"Best 3"** model remains the most robust safeguard for tournament integrity. It ensures that every player is competing against their own **best demonstrated performance**, which is the only fair way to balance a field of varying skill levels.

**Action Item:** Confirm **Best 3 (Potential)** as the 2026 Tournament Standard.
